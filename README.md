# Design System

A scalable, accessible, and responsive design system built for a Front-End Developer Internship assignment. This project demonstrates expertise in **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Storybook**, delivering a token-based color system, data display components (Tooltip, Badge), and a navigation component (Tabs) with comprehensive documentation.

## Project Overview

- **Token-Based Color System**: Primary, secondary, tertiary, neutral, and semantic colors with light/dark mode support.
- **Components**: Tooltip (data display), Tabs (navigation), and Badge (data display) with variants, states, and accessibility features.
- **Storybook Documentation**: Detailed stories covering props, states, use cases, accessibility, and theming.
- **Deployment**: Storybook deployed via Vercel for interactive previews.
- **Testing**: Cross-browser compatibility, responsiveness, and zoom support up to 200%.
